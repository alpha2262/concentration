User Stories
* As a user, I click a card and it displays a hidden value
* When I click a second card, the first card remains posted and if it matches
the first card, both cards stay visible
* If only one card matches, both cards text/images are hidden again
* If all cards have been correctly matched, the game ends
* I have the ability to start the game by clicking a button, which will
start a timer


Bronze:
* four items clickable
* if two selected and the same, stay up
* if two selected and not the same, flip back over
* basic text layout; nothing pretty yet

Silver:
* if all four selected, game ends?
* graphics, improve UX
* added icons, ideally ability to scale addition of icons or future select #
* start button added
* timer to count time tied to starter
* added urban image gifs
* flipping action on card selection

Gold:
* selection of a second game
* random ordering of cards? creating unlimited games?
* select of number of tiles?
* time decreases with each successive game


// check if class matches and switched to 'on's
  //on second click, second item displays
    //do first and second item match?
      //if yes, continue to display and update variable to show
      //if no, flip both first and second back to blank after 1 second
    //are all blocks visible?
      //if so, game ends
      //if not, restart matching function
