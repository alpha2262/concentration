Pseduo coding prework:
// check if class matches and switched to 'on's
  //on second click, second item displays
    //do first and second item match?
      //if yes, continue to display and update variable to show
      //if no, flip both first and second back to blank after 1 second
    //are all blocks visible?
      //if so, game ends
      //if not, restart matching function

      //if all squares complete, game ends

        //when user selects timer, the timer will start and icons become selectable

        //var for keeping track of what's displayed/not. class show on/off?


        //on click, the block displays
          //on second click, second item displays
            //do first and second item match?
              //if yes, continue to display and update variable to show
              //if no, flip both first and second back to blank after 1 second
            //are all blocks visible?
              //if so, game ends
              //if not, restart matching function

        //on end when all matching, stop timer, alert 'good job!'
        //prompt to reset game?
